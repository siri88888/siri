Programming paradigm:
-its related to the way of writing code
1.procedural programming:
-hat to do and how to do-->function
ex:C,C++,python
2.declrative programming:
-only telling what to do not how to do:
-commnad based
-SQL
3.object oriented programming:

OOP:
-coding a real world problem using the object orinted
feature

OOD:
-we are mapping the real world problem using object oriented features
When we say any programming language is a OOP?
-if the programming follows all the features of OOP then
only we can say that its a purely OOP langauage
-if a single feature is not followed then we cannot
say that its a purely OOP langauge
features of OOP:
1.Abstraction
2.Encapsulation
3.Data Hiding 
4.Inheritance
5.Polymorphism

C++--->not follows the encapsulation
Python--->not follows the data hiding-->not purely OOP

NVT:Techniques:Noun verb technique

assume-->web application-->website-->driving school
customer will come to website--
registration
booking a slot
payment
slot is booked

Noun:customer,slot,payment--->class
Verb:registration,booking----->methods of the class
class:
-class is a user defined data type.
-class is a kind of template which contains the data or attributes and methods
syntax:
   class class_name:
        body
	class--->keyword
	class_name--->Identifier
	body-->attributes and method of the class

ex:car----->attributes-->wheels,color etc
            methods----->stopping,accelearting
  class car:
      wheels
	  color 
	  stopping()
	  accelerating()

Object:
-Object is a variable whose data type is class.
-it is instance of a class
syntax:
   obj_name=class_name(args)
-without creating the object we cannot execute the class.
-In a python everything will be created as a object.
-whenever we are writing a function inside the class
we called it as method
-outside the class-->function

__init__():
-it is a special method in a python.
-this method we called it as constructor
-we dont to call constructor
-it is automatically getting executed when we are creating
the object
-we are using the constructor to initialize a varaibles 
in the class
what type of code we are keeping inside the constructor?

OS----->1.BIOS -->it is checking that all the devices
are propery connected or not
        2.bootrap programm
we will keep that code inside the constructor whose control
we dont wanted to give it to user.

God-->programmer
earth class 
queue--->FIF0
enqueue--->inserting 

dequeue---->delete
