Use the Bisection Method to find the root of the function:
                      f(x)=x^3−4x−9
within the interval [2,3] NumPy for numerical computation.

statistical operations on numpy:
statistics:
-it is a way of solving a problem with the help of data.
-there are two types of statistics:
1.Descriptive stats:
-describing,intepreting , visualizinng the data with the help
of descriptive stats tools
2.Inferential Stats:
-we are performing the analysis on sample and we are infering
about the population
population:set of all possible data points
sample:subset of popultation

ex:How many people are happy with current launch of iphone?

Data Types in Statistics:

1.Numerical data:it is dealing with a number:
  1.Discrete data:
  when convert a data into fraction and it is not making any sense then
  we can called it as discrete data
  ex:I have 2.5 phone--->3
  2.Contnuous data :
  when convert a data into fraction and it is making a sense then
  we can called it as contnuous data
  
  9:00
  9:05
  9:05:20
  9:05:20:45
  
  weight=78kg
        =78.33kg
		=78.34567kg
  
  I have 3.2 laptops
  
  i have 3 laptops

2.categorical data:it is dealing with group of people or category

Gender:Male,Female
educational detail:Btech,Mtech,Phd
1.Nominal:ctegorical data that we are only using for labeling
-but it dont have any natural order
2.Ordinal:
-but it is having a natural order

1.First moment bussiness decesion:
  measures of central tendencies
  1.mean
  2.median
  3.mode
  
bussinees-->open local pizza shop
what is the average cost of local pizza in hyderabad?

s1---->100
s2---->90
s3---->110
s4---->120
s5---->120----->average/mean=(100+90+110+120+120)/5=108

mean is giving the average value
syntax:np.mean(data)  

s1---->100
s2---->90
s3---->110
s4---->120
s5---->120
s6---->600---->average=228-->outliers
mean is getting influenced by outliers


2.Median:middle value of a data
  1.sort the data
  2.if no of data points are odd-->median=middle value
    if no of data points are even-->m1+m2/2=median
s1---->100
s2---->90
s3---->110
s4---->120
s5---->120
s6---->600-->median=(110+120)/2=115
median is not influenced by outliers
-we can find out the mean and median only for numerical data
syntax:np.median()
mode:
-it is used for categorical data 
-it is giving the max frequency occurrence

pizza:insta-->600rs

happy,happy,happy,unhappy,unhappy

mode:happy

happy,happy,happy,unhappy,unhappy,unhappy..

sentiment of people-->bi modal

2.second moment bussiness decesion:
  measeures of disperssion:
  
 1.variance:
  how far the particular datapoint is from the mean
  data:
  weights:
         20kg
		 30kg
		 40kg
		 50kg
 variance always give the larger value as well as the square of
 the measurement so to scale down that we use SD
 np.var(data)
 2.Standard deviation:
 how far the particular datapoint is from the mean
 -squareroot of variance
 np.std(data)
 3.range:
 
 
  
 
 
 p1--->184cm
