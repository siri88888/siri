Exceptional Handling:
Error:
-unexpected event which disturbs normal flow of execution.
-we havw three types of error:
1.syntax error
2.runtime error 
3.Logical error

python--->programming langauge-->it has a grammer
grammer:set of rules

1.syntax error:we will get syntax error when we are not
following the programming language rule
-once we got a syntax error we will not able to execute the code
-to rectify a syntax error we need to follow a proper
programming language rule
-no output

2.Logical error:
-Logical error ,we wont get any kind of syntax or runtime error.
-we will get the output in a logical error but it is a wrong output
-logic of code is not correct so we are getting wrong output.

3.Runtime error:
-we wont get any syntax error.
-In runtime error program will terminate in abonormal way
-runtime error we called it as exception.
In\ a python we dont have any kind of segmentation fault
if python try to use the low level programming language library
it leads to segmentation fault.
IVT-->interrupt vector table
Exceptional handling:
-it is not process of reactifying error its just a alternate
way of doing that thing
-our abnormal termination--->normal termination.
how we are doing the exceptional handling?
-Exceptional Handling block:
1.try 
2.except 
3.finally 


Try block:
-risky code
-a code whcih  raise the exception
-In a try block we are keeping the risky code


except block:
-it will contains handlin code
-if the exception is getting raise to handle that
exception we have to write a handling code that code
we are keeping inside except block
-excepy block will only execute when there is a exception
if there is no exception except block will not execute.

finally block:
- weather the exception is getting raised or not the finally
block is definately getting executed.
-it is a block just for cleanup purpose
