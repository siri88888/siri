OOD:mapping a real world problem by using object oriented feature
OOP:coding the real world problem using OOP  features
NVT techiques:
Nouns--->class
verb---->methods inside the class
class:
-it is a user defiined data type
-data or attributes and methods
syntax:
   class class_name:
        body
		
object:
-object is a variable whose data type is class.
syntax:
 obj=class_name()
 
 if we want to execute a class definately we have to create an object.
 we can create any number of objects per class.
 
 method vs function
 function inside the class--->method
 function outside the class-->function
 
 def __init__():
 -special method--->constructor
 -once we create the object constructor is automatically getting called
 -constructor will initialize the values of data in class
 -the code whose control i dont wanted to give to user that code
 we will keep inside the constructor.
 we have a three types of constructor:
 1.defualt
 2.parametrized
 3.building 
 
 reference variable:
 -a variable whci reffers to the current object
 -self-->refernce variable
 -object is getting created inside the heap segment
 Data hiding:
 -by deafult all the data present inside the class is public
 access specifier:
 1.public:data is accessible anyone
 2.private
 3.protected--->not there in python
 
 __variable-->to make it private
 
 _classname__variable_name
 data hiding is not completely possible in python...
 so python is not an pure object oriented programming.
 
Inheritance:
-it is a mechanism where one class is accessing the properties of another class
-it supports the reusability
-extensibilty.
-we have a 5 types of inheritance in python....
1.single inheritance
2.Multilevel inheritance
3.multiple inheritance
4.heirarchical inheritance
5.Hybrird 

1.single inheritance:
base class-->from this class only we are creating a new class
derived:a class which inherited from base class
-we have one base class and one derived class
syntax:
    class base:
	    pass
	class derived(base):
	    pass
super():it is a method which is used to access the methods of the base class
inside the derived class
